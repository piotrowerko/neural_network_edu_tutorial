<h3>Simple, educational exemple
of forward feed and backpropagation.</h3>

The sole purpose of this script is to show how a simple neural network works, not to train it.
Therefore, it is limited to the strategy analogous to the stochastic gradient descent (one training example ends one epoch).
The example shows the update of only 3 selected connections.
The operation of training based on other strategies
(e.g. weight averaging based on sending mini-batches with randomization) will be covered by other modules.
